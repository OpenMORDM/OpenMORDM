Title: A library for multiobjective robust decision making (MORDM) and
    visualizing high-dimensional datasets.

Description: OpenMORDM provides support for visualizing high-dimensional
    datasets loaded from matrices or data.frames and a variety of file formats
    including CSV, XLS, XLSX, and MOEA runtime outputs (from the Borg MOEA or
    MOEA Framework).  This visualization is contained within a web-based viewer
    capable of generating various 2D and 3D plots as well as performing a
    number of analyses.  Additionally, the R functions provide the means for
    evaluating models under uncertainty and deep uncertainty and computing
    different robustness metrics.
